# Shortest-Route-Finder

The Shortest Path Finder is a web-based project that visualizes the shortest path between nodes using Dijkstra's Algorithm. It allows users to interactively create nodes, add weighted edges, and calculate the shortest path from a given source node to all other nodes.

# Features
-Interactive Node Creation: Click anywhere on the drawing area to create nodes.
-Dynamic Edge Addition: Add edges between nodes with automatically or manually assigned weights.
-Shortest Path Calculation: Uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to compute and display the shortest path from a selected source node.
-Editable Edge Weights: Change edge weights dynamically for different scenarios.
-Visual Path Indication: Highlights the shortest path on the graph.
-Reset and Clear Options: Reset the drawing area to start over.
