# ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The Shortest Path Finder is a web-based project that visualizes the shortest path between nodes using Dijkstra's Algorithm. It allows users to interactively create nodes, add weighted edges, and calculate the shortest path from a given source node to all other nodes.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Interactive node creation: Click anywhere on the drawing area to create nodes.
- Dynamic edge addition: Add edges between nodes with automatically or manually assigned weights.
- Shortest Path Calculation: Uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to compute and display the shortest path from a selected source node.
- Editable Edge Weights: Change edge weights dynamically for different scenarios.
- Visual shortest path highlighting: Highlights the shortest path on the graph.
- Responsive design
